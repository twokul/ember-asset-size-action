# Ember Asset Size

This action will calculate the diff in asset size for your main JS files and CSS files for each PR. It will then comment with the change in asset size on each PR.

## Example usage

Create a file named `.github/workflows/ember-assets.yml` in your repo and add the following:

```yaml
name: Ember Asset Sizes

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2-beta
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0
    - uses: simplabs/ember-asset-size-action@v1
      with:
        repo-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
        update-comments: true
```

`update-comments` is an optional input. When set to true the bot will search for a comment it has already made on an issue and update it, instead of creating a new one each run.

Note: as this action requires access to the "base" commit of a PR branch we need to fetch the whole repo by adding `fetch-depth: 0` to the `actions/checkout` configuration.
